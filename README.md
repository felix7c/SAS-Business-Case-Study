# SAS-Business-Case-Study
A SAS case study of importing and analysing (fictional) customer data.  

See the reports created in the Report folder for example output. (note the ignore.txt files are only there so the folders will be correctly created for this). 

To run, run autoxec.sas then Run_Me.sas to run sections A,B and C all at once.
